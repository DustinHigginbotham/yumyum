Crafting the perfect recipe backstory can be time-consuming, and let's be honest, not everyone has a heartwarming tale about artisanal rosemary or a life-changing bowl of soup. But don't worry, we've got you covered!

## Development

Make sure you have Task installed on your machine: https://taskfile.dev/installation/

Copy the `.task-env.sample` file to `.task-env` and then replace the values as needed.

Run the API with:
```bash
task api
```

Run the web client with:
```bash
task web
```
